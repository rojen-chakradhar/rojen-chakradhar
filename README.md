Im a UI/UX and Game Developer based in Nepal.
<br><br>
I design and build whatever I can imagine and want to make.
<br><br>
If an idea pops into my head, I work on it and chances are Ill ship it.
<br><br>
Im currently learning advance web dev and game dev.
<br><br>
Im currently working on a 2d platformer game. Its my goal to finish it and let people enjoy. It is taking alot of time but I will try by best to complete it by end of this year.
<br><br>
My main tech stack are react, javascript, tailwind, GSAP, GDscript, and HTML and CSS. My favrouite tools are figma, chatgpt, and my favourite game engine is godot.
<br><br>
Ive got a bunch of projects, but my favrouite is the [Daydream Parkour](https://rojenrandom.itch.io/daydream-parkour).
<br><br>
Ive built over 15 public repos, but privately... it's probably more than 40 at this point.
