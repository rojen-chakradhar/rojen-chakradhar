## Hi there 👋

I'm [Rojen](https://rojen-porttfolio.netlify.app/), a UI/UX developer based in Nepal.

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is react, javascript, tailwind, GSAP, GDscript, html and css. My favrouite tools are figma, webflow, lovable, chatgpt, and my favourite engine is godot.

I've got a bunch of projects, but my favrouite is the [Daydream Parkour](https://rojenrandom.itch.io/daydream-parkour).

I've built over 15 public repos, but privately... it's probably more than 20 at this point.

If you want to see my projects, visit my [![portfolio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Portfolio-255E63?style=for-the-badge&logo=About.me&logoColor=white)](https://rojen-porttfolio.netlify.app/).
